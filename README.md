At NYU, a commitment to **excellence, fairness, honesty, and respect** within and outside the classroom is essential to maintaining the integrity of our community. By accepting membership in this community, students take responsibility for demonstrating these values in their own conduct and for recognizing and supporting these values in others. In turn, these values will create a campus climate that encourages the free exchange of ideas, promotes scholarly excellence through active and creative thought, and allows community members to achieve and be recognized for achieving their highest potential.

In pursuing these goals, NYU expects and requires its students to adhere to the **highest standards of scholarship, research, and academic conduct**. Essential to the process of teaching and learning is the periodic assessment of students' academic progress through measures such as papers, examinations, presentations, and other projects. **Academic dishonesty compromises the validity of these assessments as well as the relationship of trust within the community.** Students who engage in such behavior will be subject to review and the possible imposition of penalties in accordance with the standards, practices, and procedures of NYU and its colleges and schools. Violations may result in failure on a particular assignment, failure in a course, suspension or expulsion from the University, or other penalties.

Faculty are expected to guide students in understanding other people's ideas, in developing and clarifying their own thinking, and in using and conscientiously acknowledging resources—an increasingly complex endeavor given the current environment of widely available and continually emerging technologies that can produce text, images, code, video, and the like.  
In addition, students come to NYU from diverse educational contexts and may have understandings regarding academic expectations that differ from those at NYU. NYU values and respects all academic traditions; however, while at NYU, students are expected to adhere to the norms and standards of academic integrity espoused by the NYU community and will be assessed in accordance with these standards. Students should ask their professors for guidance regarding these standards, including where instructor permission might override these definitions, as well as style guide preferences for citation or acknowledgement of sources for assignments in their courses.

### Examples of Academic Misconduct

The following list is **not exhaustive**, but illustrates behaviors that compromise NYU’s academic and intellectual community:

1. **Plagiarism** – Presenting work without adequate acknowledgement of its source (e.g., another person, your own earlier work, an AI tool, etc.) as though it were one’s own current work. Examples include:
   - Incorporating a sequence of words without quotation marks  
   - Paraphrasing a passage from another's work without acknowledgement  
   - Using ideas or materials from another source as though they were one’s own  

2. **Cheating** – Deceiving a faculty member or evaluator into believing that one’s mastery of a subject or discipline is greater than it is by dishonest methods, including but not limited to:
   - Bringing or accessing unauthorized materials during an examination (e.g., notes, books, or other information accessed via cell phones, computers, or other technology)  
   - Providing assistance to acts of academic misconduct/dishonesty (e.g., sharing exam answers, allowing others to copy work)  
   - Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses without express approval of all instructors  
   - Submitting work (papers, homework assignments, computer programs, experimental results, artwork, etc.) that was created by another, substantially or in whole, as one's own  
   - Submitting answers obtained from another source during an exam or providing answers to others during an exam  
   - Submitting false evaluations of group members’ work on an assigned group project  
   - Altering or forging academic documents, such as admissions materials, academic records, grade reports, add/drop forms, or course registration forms  

3. **Retaliation** – Participating in any adverse action against an individual for making a good faith report of prohibited conduct or for participating in any academic integrity proceeding.

4. **Other Violations** – Any behavior that violates the academic policies set forth by the student’s NYU school, department, or division.
